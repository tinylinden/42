## Set-up

Prepare the game as normal for three players - but with only two human players.
The dummy will act as a third player and it will play Khorne the Blood God. 
Its actions/placements will be handled by any or both of the ordinary players 
using this rule sheet. All rules from the normal game apply for the ordinary 
players. Khorne the Dummy God have a few special rules/modifications as seen below.

## The Goals

These are the goals of Khorne the Dummy God. You should try to apply them as rules
whenever the dummy does anything:

1. Always aim to win by dial advancement.
2. Always try to get two dial advancements each turn.
3. At the same time as doing the above, also try to inflict as much damage 
   as possible to the other chaos gods.

## The Summoning Phase

During the summoning phase, decide how Khorne the Dummy God play by rolling 
dice and applying the result:

### What?

1. Play one random card from hand, pay its cost.
2. If *no* Khorne card been played this turn, play one at random from hand
   *without* paying its cost. If any Khorne card was played this turn, spawn
   *1 Bloodswarn*, pay its cost.
3. Spawn *1 Bloodswarn*, pay its cost.
4. Spawn *1 Bloodletter*, pay its cost.
5. Spawn *1 Bloodletter*, pay its cost.
6. Spawn *1 Bloodthirster*, pay its cost.

> Note 1: If the result is impossible (no cards in hand or not enough power
> points left for example), re-roll.

> Note 2: During the first roll in the first summoning phase of the game,
> re-roll all 1 and 2.

### Where?

1. Same area as (in order): most Peasant, alone Peasant, area with most 
   corruption.
2. Same area as *Slanesh* or in any area without Khorne presence.
3. Same area as *Nurgle* or in the area with the most expensive cards.
4. Same area as *Tzeentch* or in a populous area.
5. Support! In any random area that already has some presence of *Khorne*.
6. Most! In order: most enemy targets, most corruption, most tokens, most
   possible points.

> Note 1: If there is a location for chosen action that can't in any way be 
> argued against, place the card (or figure) there. Do not cheat Khorne
> the Dummy God!

> Note 2: Try to avoid *pointelss* play, if it happens - re-roll. Please 
> notice that *bad* play from Khorne is OK and should not be re-rolled - but
> pointless moves/card placement should.

> Note 3: Special rule. Khorne may place its Cultists (Bloodsworn) anywhere 
> on the board, even in areas non-adjacent or empty of Khorne controlled figures.

> Note 4: Unlike the ordinary game, Peasants killed by Khorne the Dummy God 
> will count towards its dial advancement condition, just like any other 
> (enemy) figure would.

## The Battle Phase

When Khorne the Dummy God fight, apply the main goals as well as the following:

1. Inflict as many hits and kills as possible.
2. If possible, try to stop your opponents to score points and/or place corruption 
   tokens unless you directly favor from it.

Always apply the worst possible result for the other players and remember the goals 
of Khorne the Dummy God! If it is absolutely uncertain who the dummy would choose 
to attack - decide randomly with a roll of the dice (example: roll 1D6, 1-3 attack 
opponent A, 4-6 attack opponent B). If given the choice of killing a Peasant or a 
figure owned by another player, Khorne the Dummy God will kill the peasant last.

## The End Phase

When Khorne the Dummy God gains an upgrade, draw 1 at random.

## Comments

These rules have provided fun since they work fast and smooth but also give the 
players quite an effective opponent. Sometimes Khorne the Dummy God make stupid 
moves, sometimes brilliant. Sometimes it wins, sometimes not. As an additional 
help to have this rule-set work, the use of common sense and from time to time, 
a dice roll, is recommended!
